      <li class="emph">Why does X not work or look weird?</li>
      <li>
        Linking pages is slightly difficult, and these errors sometimes slip by
      </li>
      <li>
        As for things not looking good, would you rather me spend time on making
        random things look go or actually make them?
      </li>
      <li>
        Just note I am the only person in about four to five schools doing this,
        I have homework too
      </li>
      <wbr />
      <li class="emph">Why can't Go&zwj;Guardian see this page?</li>
      <li>
        Extensions can only access file pages if allowed by the users, as they
        are by default not able to
      </li>
      <li>
        Whenever this is because the school forgot to patch this setting or
        because it would be a security risk if they could,<br />this option is
        what allows these things to happen
      </li>
      <wbr />
      <li class="emph">Can I use the proxies to go on stuff?</li>
      <li>
        Yes, the proxies have been fully implemented, and using about:blank and
        other things, we are able to put the proxies into bunker.
      </li>
      <wbr />
      <li class="emph">Why is chat not working?</li>
      <li>
        The chatroom may be down, or just off due to spam. It is currently being
        redone so there may be some issues.
      </li>
      <li></li>
      <li>
        Otherwise, you can get to apps, and other things by typing their file
        path into there.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you don't know what the file path to things are, you can try looking
        at bunker files, or on our github.
      </li>
      <wbr />
      <li class="emph">What are apps?</li>
      <li>
        Each app is a different plugin to the home screen, and sometimes beyond
        (example: communication<br />has multiple back pages)
      </li>
      <li>
        Since this "site" is just files on a usb drive, users can install apps
        as they like, for example<br />a game list app, or a news/rss feed app
      </li>
      <wbr />
      <li class="emph">How do I use the "File Path" Optiom?</li>
      <li>
        The file path option allows you to get to apps, and other pages within
        bunker faster.
      </li>
      <li>
        If something is broken, or not working just enter /index.html into the
        file path.
      </li>

      <li class="emph">How is this hidden from my history?</li>
      <li>about:blank is hidden from your history as it isn't a real URL</li>
      <li>
        If you check your history, you will see that it does not appear as what
        you were on, and clicking on it will do nothing.
      </li>
      <wbr />
      <li class="emph">How do I install apps?</li>
      <li>
        Download and extract the app's folder, then place it under the
        <code>apps</code> folder
      </li>
      <li>Be careful not to rename the folder, as it will break the app</li>
      <li>
        Then open config.json (in the root folder of this site) and add a item
        with the app's folder name
      </li>
      <li>
        The config.json file will have a few apps already on it, so follow the
        same pattern
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>"apps":["app1", "app2", "app3"]</code> adding "app4" would look
        like <code>"apps":["app1", "app2", "app3", "app4"]</code>
